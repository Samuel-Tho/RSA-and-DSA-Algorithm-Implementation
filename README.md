# RSA-and-DSA-Algorithm-Implementation

Runs implementations of the RSA and DSA algorithms as part of a 4th year maths project (report included). The DSA section is of particular interest as it is able 
to run a very basic version of a cryptocurrency system.

The folders DSA_Section and RSA_Section each follow their respective chapters from Information_Theory_Project. They outline how each example in the project is implemented. These implementations use toy variables however it would be possible to increase these to full size systems with relative ease. Indeed for benchmarking a mock full size system is used. A problem that will arise in this extension is generation of the parameters for the DSA algorithm, in order to do this in a reasonable time, an implementation of the  Miller-Rabin primality test and the Shaweâ€“Taylor random prime routine could be used.
